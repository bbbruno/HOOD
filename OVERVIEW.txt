HOOD - Human Odometry Outdoor Data Set

Abstract:
---------

72 recordings of accelerometer and gyroscope data from one volunteer performing 6
motion types (slow walking, normal walking, running, slow crawling, fast crawling,
slithering) along 3 different path configurations (straight line, closed loop,
zig-zag) with 4 sensor placements (foot, waist, wrist, chest).

Data Set Information:
---------------------
HOOD is a public collection of labelled accelerometer and gyroscope data recordings
to be used for the design and validation of Personal Dead Reckoning (PDR) systems.

The dataset is composed of the 72 combinations of:
- 6 motion types
	1. Slow walk (avg. 25 steps/min)
	2. Normal walk (avg. 50 steps/min)
	3. Run (avg. 75 steps/min)
	4. Slow crawl (avg. 20 steps/min)
	5. Fast crawl (avg. 40 steps/min)
	6. Slither (avg. 18 steps/min)
- 3 path configurations
	1. Straight line (40.32 m; 18.32 m; 7.32 m)
	2. Closed loop (113.64 m; 47.64 m; 20.14 m)
	3. Zig-zag (59.74 m; 28.77 m; 16.93 m)
- 4 sensor placements
	1. Foot (left)
	2. Waist (front-left)
	3. Wrist (right)
	4. Chest (top-center)

The number of steps executed by the volunteer in each trial are reported in the
file "Dataset_description.pdf" inside the Data Folder.

Detailed documentation about the dataset is provided in the files README.TXT and
MANUAL.TXT inside the Data Folder.

Attribute Information:
----------------------
Each file in the dataset follows the following naming convention:
t[N]
where:
- [N]:	trial ID defined in the file "Dataset_description.pdf"
 
Each record of a file reports:
 - acceleration along the x axis of the accelerometer 
 - acceleration along the y axis of the accelerometer 
 - acceleration along the z axis of the accelerometer
 - angular velocoty about the x axis of the gyroscope
 - angular velocoty about the y axis of the gyroscope
 - angular velocoty about the z axis of the gyroscope
